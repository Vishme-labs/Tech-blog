      <p>Smart textiles are revolutionizing the world of fabrics by integrating electronic components such as sensors, actuators, and conductive threads. These innovative materials can monitor health metrics, adjust to environmental conditions, and even power small devices.</p>
      <p>Applications range from athletic wear that tracks performance to medical garments that monitor vital signs. In fashion, smart textiles enable interactive designs and responsive clothing. The technology is also being explored for military and industrial uses.</p>
      <p>Challenges include durability, washability, and cost, but ongoing research is making smart textiles more practical and accessible. As the field advances, we can expect to see more everyday products enhanced by intelligent fabrics.</p>
