      <p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to access an account or system. By combining something you know (password), something you have (token or phone), and something you are (biometrics), MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.</p>
      <p>MFA is effective against common attacks like phishing, credential stuffing, and brute force. Many organizations now require MFA for sensitive systems and remote access. Implementation can include SMS codes, authenticator apps, hardware tokens, or biometric scans.</p>
      <p>While MFA adds a layer of security, it is important to balance usability and protection. Organizations should educate users on the importance of MFA and provide support for setup and troubleshooting.</p>
      <p>As cyber threats evolve, MFA remains a critical tool for safeguarding digital assets and maintaining trust in online services.</p>
