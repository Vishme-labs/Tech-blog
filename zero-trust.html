      <p>Zero Trust Security is a modern cybersecurity framework that assumes no user or device, inside or outside the network, should be trusted by default. This approach is a response to the increasing sophistication of cyber threats and the shift to cloud-based environments.</p>
      <p>Zero Trust relies on continuous verification of user identities, strict access controls, and micro-segmentation of networks. It emphasizes the principle of "never trust, always verify," reducing the risk of lateral movement by attackers within a compromised network.</p>
      <p>Implementing Zero Trust requires a combination of technologies, including multi-factor authentication, endpoint security, and real-time monitoring. Organizations must also foster a culture of security awareness among employees.</p>
      <p>As cyber threats evolve, Zero Trust Security provides a robust defense strategy, helping organizations protect sensitive data and maintain trust in an increasingly digital world.</p>
