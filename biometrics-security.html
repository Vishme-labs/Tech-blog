      <p>Biometric authentication uses unique physical or behavioral characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial features, or voice patterns, to verify identity. Biometrics offer convenience and strong security, but also raise privacy and ethical concerns.</p>
      <p>Biometric systems are widely used in smartphones, border control, and secure facilities. However, biometric data, if compromised, cannot be changed like a password. Protecting this sensitive information is critical.</p>
      <p>Organizations must implement strong encryption, secure storage, and transparent privacy policies when using biometrics. Users should be informed about how their data is collected and used.</p>
      <p>As technology advances, biometrics will play an increasing role in security, but must be balanced with privacy and user rights.</p>
