      <p>Green computing is an approach to designing, manufacturing, and using technology in ways that minimize environmental impact. As the world becomes increasingly digital, the energy consumption and e-waste generated by technology are growing concerns.</p>
      <p>Innovations in energy-efficient hardware, cloud computing, and data center management are helping reduce the carbon footprint of IT infrastructure. Companies are adopting renewable energy sources, optimizing cooling systems, and developing recyclable materials for devices.</p>
      <p>Software also plays a role, with algorithms designed to minimize computational waste and applications that encourage sustainable user behavior. Governments and organizations are setting standards and incentives to promote green practices across the tech industry.</p>
      <p>By embracing green computing, we can ensure that technological progress goes hand in hand with environmental stewardship, creating a more sustainable future for all.</p>
