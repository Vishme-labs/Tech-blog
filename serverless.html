      <p>Serverless computing is a cloud computing model that abstracts server management, allowing developers to focus on writing code without worrying about infrastructure. With serverless, resources are automatically allocated as needed, and users pay only for what they use.</p>
      <p>This model accelerates development, reduces operational overhead, and enables rapid scaling. Popular serverless platforms include AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions. These services support a wide range of programming languages and integrate with other cloud offerings.</p>
      <p>Serverless is ideal for event-driven applications, such as APIs, data processing, and automation tasks. However, it also introduces challenges, including cold start latency, vendor lock-in, and monitoring complexity.</p>
      <p>As serverless technology matures, new tools and best practices are emerging to address these challenges, making it an increasingly attractive option for organizations seeking agility and cost efficiency in the cloud.</p>
