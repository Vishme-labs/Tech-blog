      <p>Augmented reality (AR) overlays digital information onto the physical world, creating immersive experiences that enhance how we interact with our environment. From gaming and entertainment to education and industry, AR is finding applications across diverse fields.</p>
      <p>AR technology relies on sensors, cameras, and advanced software to blend virtual objects with real-world scenes. Popular applications include mobile games like Pokémon GO, interactive museum exhibits, and AR navigation in vehicles.</p>
      <p>In business, AR is used for remote assistance, product visualization, and training simulations. The technology is also making waves in healthcare, where surgeons use AR overlays for precision during operations.</p>
      <p>As hardware becomes more affordable and software more sophisticated, AR is set to become a mainstream tool for communication, learning, and entertainment, bridging the gap between the digital and physical worlds.</p>
