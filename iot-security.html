      <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) connects billions of devices worldwide, from smart home gadgets to industrial sensors. While IoT brings convenience and efficiency, it also introduces new security risks. Many devices lack robust security features, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals.</p>
      <p>Common threats include unauthorized access, data breaches, and botnet attacks. Weak passwords, outdated firmware, and insecure communication protocols are frequent vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>To secure IoT environments, manufacturers and users should implement strong authentication, regular updates, network segmentation, and device monitoring. Regulatory standards and industry best practices are evolving to address these challenges.</p>
      <p>By prioritizing security in IoT deployments, we can harness the benefits of connected devices while minimizing risks to privacy and safety.</p>
