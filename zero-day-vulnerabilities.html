      <p>Zero-day vulnerabilities are security flaws in software or hardware that are unknown to the vendor and have no available fix. Attackers exploit these weaknesses before developers can patch them, making zero-days highly valuable and dangerous.</p>
      <p>Zero-day attacks can target operating systems, browsers, applications, and even hardware components. Cybercriminals may use them for espionage, data theft, or sabotage. Detecting zero-days is challenging, as traditional security tools may not recognize new exploits.</p>
      <p>Organizations can reduce risk by maintaining up-to-date systems, employing advanced threat detection, and participating in vulnerability disclosure programs. Collaboration between vendors, researchers, and users is essential to quickly identify and address zero-day threats.</p>
      <p>By staying vigilant and proactive, organizations can minimize the impact of zero-day vulnerabilities and protect their critical assets.</p>
