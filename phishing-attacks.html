      <p>Phishing attacks remain one of the most common and effective cyber threats. These attacks use deceptive emails, messages, or websites to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data. Attackers often impersonate trusted organizations or individuals, making their messages appear legitimate.</p>
      <p>Recognizing phishing attempts is crucial. Look for suspicious sender addresses, generic greetings, urgent or threatening language, and unexpected attachments or links. Hover over links to check their true destination before clicking. Never provide sensitive information in response to unsolicited requests.</p>
      <p>Organizations can protect themselves by implementing email filtering, multi-factor authentication, and regular security awareness training for employees. Reporting suspected phishing attempts helps security teams respond quickly and prevent further attacks.</p>
      <p>By staying vigilant and following best practices, individuals and organizations can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing scams.</p>
