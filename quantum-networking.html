      <p>Quantum networking is poised to revolutionize digital communication by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical networks, quantum networks use qubits and entanglement to enable ultra-secure data transmission and new forms of connectivity.</p>
      <p>One of the most promising applications is quantum key distribution (QKD), which allows two parties to share encryption keys with security guaranteed by the laws of physics. This technology could render eavesdropping virtually impossible, making it invaluable for governments, financial institutions, and critical infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Building a quantum internet requires advances in quantum repeaters, error correction, and integration with existing networks. Researchers are making rapid progress, with experimental quantum networks already spanning cities and even countries.</p>
      <p>As quantum networking matures, it will enable new applications such as distributed quantum computing and ultra-precise time synchronization, ushering in a new era of secure, high-performance communication.</p>
