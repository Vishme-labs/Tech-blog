      <p>Biodegradable plastics are designed to break down more quickly than traditional plastics, reducing their impact on the environment. Made from renewable resources such as corn starch or sugarcane, these materials decompose under specific conditions, helping to address the global problem of plastic pollution.</p>
      <p>While biodegradable plastics offer environmental benefits, challenges remain in ensuring proper disposal and composting. Not all biodegradable plastics break down in natural environments, and some require industrial composting facilities.</p>
      <p>Ongoing research is focused on improving the performance and accessibility of biodegradable plastics. As regulations and consumer demand for sustainable products grow, these materials are expected to play a larger role in reducing plastic waste.</p>
