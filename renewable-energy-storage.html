      <p>Renewable energy sources like solar and wind are essential for a sustainable future, but their intermittent nature poses challenges for grid reliability. Advances in energy storage technologies, such as lithium-ion batteries, flow batteries, and thermal storage, are enabling greater integration of renewables into the power grid.</p>
      <p>Energy storage systems store excess energy when production exceeds demand and release it when needed, balancing supply and demand. This capability supports grid stability, reduces reliance on fossil fuels, and enables the transition to cleaner energy sources.</p>
      <p>Ongoing research is focused on improving storage capacity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. As these technologies mature, they will play a critical role in achieving global sustainability goals and combating climate change.</p>
