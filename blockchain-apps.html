      <p>Blockchain technology, best known as the foundation of cryptocurrencies, is finding new applications across industries. Its core features—decentralization, transparency, and immutability—make it ideal for use cases beyond digital currency.</p>
      <p>In supply chain management, blockchain enables end-to-end traceability, helping companies verify the origin and journey of products. In digital identity, blockchain provides secure, user-controlled credentials, reducing the risk of identity theft.</p>
      <p>Other applications include secure voting systems, decentralized finance (DeFi), and intellectual property management. As blockchain platforms evolve, scalability and interoperability are improving, making the technology more accessible and practical for real-world use.</p>
      <p>While challenges such as regulatory uncertainty and energy consumption remain, the potential of blockchain to transform industries is undeniable. As adoption grows, we can expect to see even more innovative uses emerge.</p>
