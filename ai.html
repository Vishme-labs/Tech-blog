    <h1>Artificial Intelligence: Shaping the Future</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a family of techniques that learn patterns from data and turn them into predictions, rankings, decisions, or creative output. Classic approaches rely on compact models and hand‑engineered features, while modern <strong>deep learning</strong> learns useful representations directly from raw text, images, audio, or code. Training adjusts parameters to minimize error on examples; inference applies the trained model to new inputs to produce outcomes. AI is transforming industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation.</p>
    <h2>Layers of AI: Perception, Reasoning, and Action</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Think of AI in three layers: <strong>perception</strong>, <strong>reasoning</strong>, and <strong>action</strong>. Perception turns raw signals into structured information—detecting objects, transcribing speech, parsing language. Reasoning weighs options and plans steps toward a goal. Action delivers results—ranking search, approving a transaction, or guiding a robot arm. In practice, these layers are chained so perception informs reasoning which drives action. AI applications include computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.</p>

    <h2>Data Quality and Responsible AI</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Data quality sets the ceiling for AI performance. Diverse, well‑labeled examples help models generalize; noise, imbalance, and hidden shortcuts create brittle behavior. Often a small investment in better data beats a big investment in bigger models. Feature stores standardize inputs across teams, and evaluation suites measure not only accuracy but calibration, latency, and fairness. <strong>Responsible AI</strong> practices—dataset documentation, reproducibility, and human‑in‑the‑loop review—make systems safer and easier to debug.</p>

    <h2>AI in Production and Monitoring</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Operating AI in production resembles running any distributed system, with a few extra dials. You still monitor request rates, error codes, and tail latency, but you also watch for data drift, feedback loops, and the gap between offline evaluation and real‑world outcomes. Canary releases and shadow testing reduce upgrade risk. When objectives change, you retrain or fine‑tune models. Treat models as living artifacts: schedule evaluations, capture feedback, and maintain a clear audit trail of versions and metrics.</p>
    <h2>AI Safety, Ethics, and Future Trends</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Safety and ethics are choices made early, not patches added late. Bias can creep in through unbalanced datasets or deployment contexts that differ from training. Privacy matters because many inputs are sensitive. Techniques like differential privacy, federated learning, and careful access controls limit exposure while enabling learning. The near future is multimodal—systems that jointly reason over text, images, audio, and video—and smaller specialized models that run efficiently on modest hardware. AI will continue to shape the future of technology and society.</p>
