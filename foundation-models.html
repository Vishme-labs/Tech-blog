      <h2>Defining Foundation Models</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Foundation models are large-scale pretrained models trained on broad data that can be adapted to many downstream tasks. By pretraining on diverse corpora, they capture general-purpose representations that reduce data needs for task-specific fine-tuning.</p>

      <h2>Capabilities and Risks</h2>
      <p class="reveal">These models power translation, summarization, multimodal tasks, and more. However, they also present risks including biases in training data, high computational cost, and potential misuse—requiring careful governance and evaluation.</p>

      <h3>Fine-Tuning and Prompting</h3>
      <p class="reveal">Practitioners leverage fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and adapters to specialize foundation models for specific use-cases, balancing performance, cost, and safety considerations.</p>

      <h2>Responsible Deployment</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Responsible deployment involves evaluation for fairness, continuous monitoring, and access controls. Open research and shared benchmarks support better understanding and safer use of foundation models.</p>
