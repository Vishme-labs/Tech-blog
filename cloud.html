<p class="reveal">Cloud computing reshapes how teams plan capacity, ship software, and pay for infrastructure. Instead of forecasting demand months in advance and purchasing hardware upfront, organizations rent compute, storage, and networking as elastic utilities. That switch sounds simple, but it unlocks new habits: experiments are cheap, scaling successful ideas is fast, and reliability can be designed in from day one. The cloud isn’t a single product; it’s a toolbox that removes undifferentiated heavy lifting so people can focus on customer value.</p>
<p class="reveal">A helpful mental model divides services into three layers. <strong>Infrastructure as a Service</strong> exposes virtual machines, software‑defined networks, and block or object storage. Engineers wire these together like Lego bricks when they need fine‑grained control. <strong>Platform as a Service</strong> abstracts more: you push code and define autoscaling rules, while the platform handles runtimes, load balancing, and rolling updates. <strong>Software as a Service</strong> sits even higher; entire applications are consumed as subscriptions, ideal when customization is limited and time‑to‑value matters most.</p>

<p class="reveal">Modern cloud architectures favor loose coupling and automation. Containers bundle code and dependencies so a service behaves consistently across environments. Orchestrators schedule containers across clusters, heal failures automatically, and roll out new versions with minimal disruption. <em>Infrastructure as code</em> expresses networks, gateways, and policies in version‑controlled templates so environments are reproducible and auditable. Observability—logs, metrics, and traces—bridges the gap between assumptions and reality, letting teams find issues before customers notice.</p>

<p class="reveal">Security follows a shared‑responsibility model. Providers secure their facilities, hardware, and core control planes; customers remain responsible for identity, encryption, and the boundaries around their applications. Good posture starts with least‑privilege access and multi‑factor authentication. Encrypt data in transit and at rest, store secrets in a dedicated vault, and segment networks so that sensitive systems aren’t reachable from the public internet. Automated policy checks in CI/CD catch misconfigurations before they reach production.</p>
<p class="reveal">Cost management is as cultural as it is technical. Untagged resources and forgotten test environments quietly grow bills. Tag everything by owner and purpose, set budgets with alerts, and align pricing models to workload patterns. Predictable services often benefit from reserved capacity, while bursty tasks run cheaply on short‑lived instances. Autoscaling ties spend to demand so you pay for what you use. Many organizations adopt a <strong>FinOps</strong> mindset that blends engineering discipline with financial transparency.</p>
<p class="reveal">Not every workload moves at once. Regulations, data gravity, or latency needs may suggest a <strong>hybrid</strong> approach that keeps core systems close to protected data while pushing stateless compute to managed platforms. Some teams choose <strong>multi‑cloud</strong> to reduce concentration risk or to pick a best‑fit service for a specific task. That flexibility adds operational overhead, so document the reasons for spanning platforms and measure the value regularly. The direction is steady: give builders safer, faster paths to value with serverless, managed databases, and edge runtimes.</p>
