      <h2>A Brief History of Cloud Computing</h2>
      <p class="reveal">The concept of cloud computing has evolved over decades, beginning with mainframe time-sharing
        in the 1960s and progressing through the development of virtualization, grid computing, and the rise of the
        internet. The launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006 marked a turning point, making scalable, on-demand
        infrastructure available to businesses of all sizes. Today, cloud computing is a foundational technology for
        digital transformation across industries.</p>
      <h2>Introduction to Cloud Computing</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Cloud computing reshapes how teams plan capacity, ship software, and pay for infrastructure.
        Instead of forecasting demand months in advance and purchasing hardware upfront, organizations rent compute,
        storage, and networking as elastic utilities. Cloud technology enables rapid experimentation, fast scaling, and
        reliable infrastructure for businesses of all sizes.</p>
      <h2>Cloud Service Models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS</h2>
      <p class="reveal">A helpful mental model divides services into three layers. <strong>Infrastructure as a Service
          (IaaS)</strong> exposes virtual machines, software‑defined networks, and block or object storage. Engineers
        wire these together like Lego bricks for fine‑grained control. <strong>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong>
        abstracts more: you push code and define autoscaling rules, while the platform handles runtimes, load balancing,
        and rolling updates. <strong>Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong> sits even higher; entire applications are
        consumed as subscriptions, ideal when customization is limited and time‑to‑value matters most.</p>
      
      <h2>Cloud Migration and Adoption</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Migrating to the cloud involves careful planning and execution. Organizations assess their
        existing workloads, prioritize applications for migration, and choose between public, private, or hybrid cloud
        models. Common migration strategies include rehosting (lift-and-shift), refactoring, and rebuilding applications
        to take full advantage of cloud-native features. Successful cloud adoption requires a cultural shift, with teams
        embracing automation, DevOps practices, and continuous learning.</p>
      <h2>Cloud Security and Best Practices</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Security follows a shared‑responsibility model. Providers secure their facilities, hardware, and
        core control planes; customers remain responsible for identity, encryption, and the boundaries around their
        applications. Good posture starts with least‑privilege access and multi‑factor authentication. Encrypt data in
        transit and at rest, store secrets in a dedicated vault, and segment networks so that sensitive systems aren’t
        reachable from the public internet. Automated policy checks in CI/CD catch misconfigurations before they reach
        production.</p>
      <h2>Future Trends in Cloud Computing</h2>
      <p class="reveal">The future of cloud computing will be shaped by emerging technologies such as edge computing,
        serverless architectures, and artificial intelligence. Edge computing brings processing closer to devices,
        reducing latency and enabling real-time applications. Serverless platforms abstract infrastructure management,
        allowing developers to focus on code. AI and machine learning services are increasingly integrated into cloud
        platforms, democratizing access to advanced analytics and automation. As cloud adoption grows, issues like data
        sovereignty, sustainability, and interoperability will become more important, driving innovation and
        collaboration across the industry.</p>
      <h2>Cloud Cost Management and FinOps</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Cost management is as cultural as it is technical. Untagged resources and forgotten test
        environments quietly grow bills. Tag everything by owner and purpose, set budgets with alerts, and align pricing
        models to workload patterns. Predictable services often benefit from reserved capacity, while bursty tasks run
        cheaply on short‑lived instances. Autoscaling ties spend to demand so you pay for what you use. Many
        organizations adopt a <strong>FinOps</strong> mindset that blends engineering discipline with financial
        transparency.</p>
      <h2>Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Strategies</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Not every workload moves at once. Regulations, data gravity, or latency needs may suggest a
        <strong>hybrid</strong> approach that keeps core systems close to protected data while pushing stateless compute
        to managed platforms. Some teams choose <strong>multi‑cloud</strong> to reduce concentration risk or to pick a
        best‑fit service for a specific task. That flexibility adds operational overhead, so document the reasons for
        spanning platforms and measure the value regularly. The direction is steady: give builders safer, faster paths
        to value with serverless, managed databases, and edge runtimes.</p>
