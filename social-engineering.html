      <p>Social engineering exploits human psychology to gain unauthorized access to systems or information. Attackers use tactics such as pretexting, baiting, and tailgating to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential data or performing actions that compromise security.</p>
      <p>Common examples include impersonating IT staff, creating fake emergencies, or leaving infected USB drives in public places. These attacks often bypass technical defenses by targeting the human element.</p>
      <p>Defending against social engineering requires ongoing security awareness training, clear policies, and a culture of skepticism. Employees should verify requests for sensitive information, report suspicious behavior, and understand the risks of oversharing on social media.</p>
      <p>By recognizing the signs of social engineering and fostering a security-conscious environment, organizations can reduce the risk of falling victim to these manipulative attacks.</p>
