      <p>Mobile devices are essential to modern life, but they are also prime targets for cyber attacks. Threats include malware, phishing, unsecured Wi-Fi, and lost or stolen devices. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in apps and operating systems to gain access to sensitive data.</p>
      <p>Protecting your mobile device requires regular software updates, strong passwords, app permissions management, and the use of security apps. Avoiding public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions and enabling remote wipe features can further enhance security.</p>
