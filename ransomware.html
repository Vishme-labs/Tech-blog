      <p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim's data and demands payment for its release. These attacks have become increasingly sophisticated, targeting businesses, hospitals, and government agencies worldwide. The financial and reputational damage caused by ransomware can be devastating.</p>
      <p>Attackers often gain access through phishing emails, unpatched software, or compromised remote desktop services. Once inside, they encrypt critical files and display a ransom note with payment instructions, usually in cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>Preventing ransomware requires a multi-layered approach: regular data backups, timely software updates, employee training, and strong access controls. In the event of an attack, organizations should avoid paying the ransom and instead work with cybersecurity professionals to restore systems and report the incident to authorities.</p>
      <p>By understanding the tactics used by cybercriminals and implementing robust defenses, businesses can reduce their vulnerability to ransomware attacks.</p>
