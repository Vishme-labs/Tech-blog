<p class="reveal">Quantum computing explores computation built on the rules of quantum mechanics. The basic unit is the <strong>qubit</strong>. While a classical bit is either 0 or 1, a qubit can be in a superposition of both. When qubits interact they can become entangled, producing correlations that cannot be explained classically. Algorithms exploit these properties to explore large spaces in ways that differ from—and sometimes asymptotically outperform—classical methods.</p>

<p class="reveal">Multiple hardware approaches compete today, including superconducting circuits, trapped ions, neutral atoms, and photonics. Each balances coherence time, gate fidelity, and scalability. That is why <strong>error correction</strong> is central: it encodes one logical qubit across many physical qubits and uses repeated measurements to detect and correct faults in real time. The overhead is large, but progress in fabrication, control electronics, and algorithms continues to reduce error rates.</p>
<p class="reveal">Where might quantum help first? Three areas stand out. First, simulating quantum systems—molecules and materials—where the target itself is quantum. Better simulations could accelerate drug discovery or identify catalysts for cleaner energy. Second, certain optimization and sampling problems may benefit from algorithms that shape probability landscapes to find good candidates faster. Third, cryptography: sufficiently large quantum computers could threaten widely used public‑key schemes, which is why post‑quantum alternatives are being standardized.</p>

<p class="reveal">For practitioners today, hybrid workflows are the most practical path. Classical optimizers coordinate with short quantum circuits to explore complex spaces. Developers prototype with high‑level tools, simulate locally, and run experiments on early hardware. The engineering feels familiar—version control, testing, monitoring—plus a dash of linear algebra. Start with education, small proofs of concept, and realistic milestones to build intuition while the hardware matures.</p>
<p class="reveal">The field resembles early aviation: remarkable demonstrations, clear potential, and plenty of engineering ahead. Over the next decade expect cleaner, larger devices; better compilers; and specialized applications where quantum offers measurable value. The biggest wins may come from mixing quantum subroutines with strong classical heuristics to get the best of both worlds.</p>
