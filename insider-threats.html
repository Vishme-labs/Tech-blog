      <p>Insider threats are security risks that originate from within an organization, often involving employees, contractors, or business partners. These threats can be intentional, such as data theft or sabotage, or unintentional, like accidental data leaks. Because insiders have legitimate access to systems and data, their actions can be difficult to detect and prevent.</p>
      <p>Real-world examples include disgruntled employees stealing intellectual property, contractors misusing access, or staff falling victim to social engineering. Organizations must balance trust with vigilance, implementing monitoring, access controls, and regular security training.</p>
      <p>Mitigating insider threats requires a combination of technical solutions and a strong security culture. By fostering transparency, encouraging reporting, and using advanced analytics, organizations can reduce the risk of internal breaches and protect sensitive information.</p>
