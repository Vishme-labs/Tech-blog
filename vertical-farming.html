      <p>Vertical farming is transforming the way we grow food by stacking crops in controlled, indoor environments. This method uses less land and water than traditional agriculture, making it ideal for urban areas where space is limited. LED lighting, hydroponics, and automation enable year-round production and reduce the need for pesticides.</p>
      <p>By bringing food production closer to consumers, vertical farming reduces transportation costs and carbon emissions. It also allows for fresher produce and greater food security in cities. As technology advances, vertical farms are becoming more efficient and scalable, offering a sustainable solution to feeding a growing global population.</p>
      <p>Challenges remain, including high startup costs and energy consumption, but ongoing research and investment are driving innovation in the field. Vertical farming represents a promising step toward a more resilient and sustainable food system.</p>
