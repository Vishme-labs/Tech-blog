      <h2>Why AI Governance Matters</h2>
      <p class="reveal">As organizations adopt artificial intelligence across products and operations, establishing clear governance is essential to manage risk, ensure fairness, and maintain public trust. AI governance covers the policies, processes, and oversight mechanisms that guide the responsible development, deployment, and monitoring of AI systems.</p>

      <h2>Core Principles</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Effective governance typically aligns with core principles: transparency, accountability, privacy protection, fairness, and robustness. Transparency means documenting model purpose, data sources, and limitations. Accountability assigns ownership for outcomes and ensures remediation paths when systems cause harm.</p>

      <h3>Transparency and Documentation</h3>
      <p class="reveal">Maintain clear model cards and data sheets that summarize architecture decisions, training data lineage, and known failure modes. Documentation helps auditors, users, and downstream teams understand how a model should and should not be used.</p>

      <h2>Governance Frameworks and Roles</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Adopt a layered approach: executive sponsorship for policy and culture, product-level risk assessment, and technical governance that includes model review boards and automated monitoring. Cross-functional committees help balance legal, ethical, and business perspectives.</p>

      <h2>Risk Assessment and Controls</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Incorporate risk grading for AI use-cases—low, medium, and high risk—then apply controls accordingly. High-risk applications should require external audits, referential testing, and human-in-the-loop safeguards. Privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy reduce data exposure risk.</p>

      <h2>Continuous Monitoring and Feedback</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Governance is not a one-time checklist. Implement continuous monitoring for model drift, performance degradation, and bias. Establish feedback loops from users and incident response plans for unexpected outcomes.</p>

      <h2>Regulation and External Standards</h2>
      <p class="reveal">Stay aligned with emerging regulations and industry best practices. Many jurisdictions are introducing AI-specific rules; organizations should proactively map obligations and adapt governance policies to meet legal requirements.</p>
